                If you’ve been looking for a new workout routine that can give you a good balance of flexibility, strength, muscle tone and help for a few aches and pains, Pilates may be the answer. It might look a bit intimidating at first, but it’s much easier to get into — and, depending on what you do, less expensive — than you might assume. While Pilates has been around for nearly 100 years, it continues gaining traction, picking up new devotees all the time.

            <p class="text-justify">
                Pilates is a form of exercise and body conditioning developed by Joseph Pilates in the early 20th century, mostly as a method of injury recovery for dancers. Bar, who has a distinguished background as a dancer herself, is no stranger to the wear and tear these athletes endure. “Fine-tuned as dancers are, when we’re at our peak, dancing at least six days a week, several hours a day, it’s grueling, and the repetitive motion puts stress on the same muscle groups again and again,” she says. That’s why, over time, it became clear that Pilates could benefit a much wider range of people — including people who aren’t injured at all.

            <p class="text-justify">
                According to lead yoga therapist Judi Bar, practicing Pilates has many potential health benefits, including increased flexibility, muscle tone, and strength. Some of the principles that guide the Pilates method include concentration on each movement, use of the abdomen and low back muscles, flowing, precise movement patterns, and controlled breathing.

            <p class="text-justify">
                Pilates is a form of strength training, but it doesn’t look like some of the other strength training exercises you might be familiar with. Pilates focuses more on improving muscle tone than building muscles, but the result is similar: greater stability and endurance. Pilates isn’t going to bulk you up — if anything, it’s designed to cultivate a longer, leaner look.

                Some general tips: Make sure you know the basics before you start. Choose a reputable instructor or class, and ensure you have the right equipment. Start slowly and listen to your body. As with any exercise, it's important to warm up properly and stay hydrated.
